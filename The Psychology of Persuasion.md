# Contrast Principle
Give them bad things first, then show them good things. They'll think the good thing is better than before. \
Tell my parent I'm a gay(actually not), then tell them I don't want to get married. They'll accept that.


Dear Mother and Dad: 

Since I left for college I have been remiss in writing and I am sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you
are sitting down, okay?

Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skullfracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out thewindow of my dormitory when it caught on fire shortly after
my arrival here is pretty well healed now. I only spent two Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 11 weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and
only get those sick headaches once a day. Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory, and my jump, was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one
who called the Fire Department and the ambulance. He also visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live
because of the burntout dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It’s really a basement room, but it’s kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and
we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven’t got the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show. 

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much
you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know
you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.
The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend
has a minor infection which prevents us from passing our
pre-marital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. 

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion
or skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant,
I am not engaged, I am not infected, and there is no boyfriend.
However, I am getting a “D” in American History, and an
“F” in Chemistry and I want you to see those marks in their
proper perspective.

# Reciprocation Principle
The Old Give and Take... and Take. 
* Give first, but just don't count. They will pay you back in the future.
* When bargain with someone, give a high price first and then make a consession. It'll give others a responsibility to make a deal. It's not that direct, but powerful.
* Exploitation attempts should be exploited.

# Consistency Principle
* What people are doing is consistent with what they were doing in the past. 
* If I'd like to ask someone for big things, I shoule ask small things first. Like "lowball".
* Outside elements will affect people's doing. But after removing the ourside factors, the inner support might have grown. Compared with outside elements, the inner support is stronger and last for longer time.
* Ask myself a question: If I go back time, will I make the same choice.

Quite wrong. You see, I recogize what has gone here. I know that your story about doing a survey was just a pretext for getting people to tell you how often they go out and that, under those circumstances, there a nature tendency to exaggerate. I also realize that your bosses selected you for this job because of your physical attractiveness and told you to wear clothes showing a lot of resilient body tissue because a pretty, scantily clad woman is likely to get men to brag about what swingers they are in order to impress her. So I'm not interested in your entertainment club because what Emerson said about foolish consistency and hobgobins of the mid. 

# Social proof
* Where all think alike, no one thinks very much  -WALTER LIPPMANN
* 5% are initiators, 95% are followers. 
* When common people are uncertain about whether they should do or not, they will follow others, especially someone simliar to them.
* When asking for help in a foreign environment, being specific is important to reduce uncertainty of onlookers.

MONKEY ME, MONKEY DO.

## How to do
We need only make a conscious decision to be alert to counterfeit social evidence, and the smug overconfidence of the exploiters will play directly into our hands. 
Exploiters should be exploited. 

# Liking - The Friendly Thief
Factors affecting liking:
* Physical Attractiveness
Certain of the consequences of uncertain assumptions that "good looking equals good". Even I don't know this factor is working. Be careful of good-looking people.

* Similarity
* Compliments
* Contact and Cooperation
It only works under harmonious and noncompetitive environment.
* Conditioning and Association
I links my loss to her. That's the main reason I don't like her.

## How to do 
Only focus on the final results. If I don't like her/him, will I still make the same deal.
