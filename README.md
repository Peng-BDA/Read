There shouldn't be any clear gulf between what I thing and what I say. When I was talking with a Swedish, I started to talk without thinking. It's also a good habit to stick to the plan strictly, which makes life easier.
Question: should I leave some time for taking notes for Math.

It's refreshing to take a little walk and collect some leaves.

Don't take the habit of picking up the phone. \
should I put more time on study on a few subjects or study more subjects? The first will exhaust me. The second will distract me on too many things. 
Main focus: Exercise, Voc, Math, (guitar), (Swedish), (Business), (up)

They talk and talk and talk-it's not so much the quantity you object to as the repetitousness. They phrase, rephrase, and re-repharese their thoughts-using far more words than necessay, overwhelming you with words, drowning you with them, until your only thought is how to escape, or maybe how to die. \
Good description to one of my friends.
